I am a computer Science Major at CSUF and I plan to graduate in 2028

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1 
Although Lab 1 was the simplest as you can get, I enjoyed it the most because it served as an introduction to what I will be learning and it was my first ever time “Coding”. But even though it is easy compared to the Labs we have now there is always something about the first time where you feel grateful for all that you have learned and will be learning. Lab 1 showed me that I really do want Computer Science to be my major.

Lab 3, Part 2
My first time being stumped by coding. Although simple now lab 3 as a whole not just part 2 kind of had me stumped, meaning that I was stuck and I didn’t know where to start or even what to write. I did end up finishing it and figuring it out but it took me around 2 and a half hours to complete it.

Lab 4, Part 2
This was my favorite moment of coding because being able to create a sort of game was a fun experience. Even though it wasn’t really a game since you were able to see the input of player 1 it is the foundation of guessing and can still be improved. It was also around the time we first started using if statements which are really important in our coding even now.
